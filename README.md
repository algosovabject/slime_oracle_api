# Graph-Based AI Agent API

## Overview
Small FastAPI project that blends machine learning with horror aesthetics. It accepts a user‚Äôs question and returns symbols and an interpretation, like consulting a digital divination system.

## Audience
Designed for technical-adjacent users who need a plain-language introduction to APIs.

## Why I wrote this: 
To round out my technical writing portfolio with an example of API documentation and technical writing.

## What it demonstrates: 
Ability to format in Markdown, write for multiple audiences, translate jargon into clear explanations, and provide glossary-style reference material.

## Preview:  

Full API reference (with request/response examples) is available here:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note  
The Slime Mold Oracle is not currently in production. It was an experimental graph-based agent I built to explore certain philosophical ideas and practice my ML/AI engineering skills. I am using this project as a writing + technical demo to showcase API documentation and playful horror aesthetics. For more information on the Slime Mold Oracle and its concepts, please check out my whitepapers posted on GitHub.
