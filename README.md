# Graph-Based AI Agent API üïπÔ∏è

## Overview
Small FastAPI project that blends machine learning with horror aesthetics. It accepts a user‚Äôs question and returns symbols and an interpretation, like consulting a digital divination system.

## Audience
Designed for technical-adjacent users who need a plain-language introduction to APIs.

## Why I wrote this: 
To demonstrate API documentation skills, including reference docs, auto-generated Swagger/ReDoc, and developer onboarding instructions.

## What it demonstrates: 
- Writing endpoint documentation with request/response examples.  
- Creating README content for local deployment and troubleshooting.  
- Structuring API docs for both technical precision and developer usability.  

## Preview:  

Full API reference (with request/response examples) is available here:
üëâ [Slime Mold Oracle API Reference](docs/API_reference.md)

Screenshots of the live docs (Swagger UI & ReDoc) can be found here: [images](docs/images)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note  
The Slime Mold Oracle is not currently in production. It was an experimental graph-based agent I built to explore certain philosophical ideas and practice my ML/AI engineering skills. I am using this project as a writing + technical demo to showcase API documentation and playful horror aesthetics. For more information on the Slime Mold Oracle and its concepts, please check out my whitepapers posted on GitHub.
