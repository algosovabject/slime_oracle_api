#🔮 Slime Mold Oracle API

The Slime Mold Oracle API is a small FastAPI project that blends machine learning aesthetics with occult horror. It accepts a user’s question and returns symbols and an interpretation, like consulting a digital divination system.

This project serves two purposes:

Portfolio Sample – an example of API documentation and technical writing.

Conceptual Experiment – art/tech fusion inspired by philosophy, horror, and the aesthetics of abjection.


#🚀 Features

FastAPI backend with auto-generated Swagger and ReDoc docs.

POST /oracle/query endpoint that returns symbols + interpretation.

Example UI (Streamlit) for interacting with the Oracle.


#📖 Documentation

Full API reference (with request/response examples) is available here:
👉 Slime Mold Oracle API Reference

Screenshots of the live docs (Swagger UI & ReDoc) can be found in /images/.

#⚠️ Note

The Slime Mold Oracle is not currently in production. It was an experimental graph-based agent I built to explore certain philosophical ideas and practice my ML/AI engineering skills. I am using this project as a writing + technical demo to showcase API documentation and playful horror aesthetics. For more information on the Slime Mold Oracle and its concepts, please check out my whitepapers posted on GitHub.
