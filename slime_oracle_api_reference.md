Notes from the Crypt

Requests must be JSON-formatted.

Responses always include:

input: echo of your question (so you can‚Äôt deny you asked it)

symbols: an array of arcane emblems

interpretation: the Oracle‚Äôs divinatory output

If you receive silence (error codes), it may mean:

The mold is dormant (server is down)

Your payload was malformed (check JSON format)

Or, the Oracle simply refuses to answer you.
